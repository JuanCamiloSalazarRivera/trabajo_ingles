      <h2>Ingrid Camila</h2>
      <p>Rio is a kind, funny and politically correct movie. Rarely have the bad guys been less bad, a city has looked more beautiful and all the inhabitants always seem willing to help their friend in misfortune and dance to the rhythm of the music. Its story is nothing original, but it is full of funny characters (a dog who dreams of dancing in the carnival, an evil cockatoo, a cute toucan), lots of action, jokes that make you smile and a story of friendship, acceptance. and courage. to conquer fears that works perfectly, all in flawless 3D.</p>

      <h3>Maze Runner: Trapped in a Labyrinth</h3>
      <p>Maze Runner was a film released on September 19, 2014 by Wes Ball. This film tells the story of a teenager named Thomas, whose memory was erased and is trapped with a group of young people in a labyrinth where they will have to find a way to escape.
      <br></br>
      This movie seems very good to me because of the way in which the events and the plot happen, since at first they stoy us to the labyrinth without knowing why or what happened. Thomas will have to adapt to the rules of the labyrinth and will gradually recover his memory, which will make him question who he was and have more and more desire to escape and see what is beyond.</p>

      <h3>La Casa de Papel</h3>
      <p>La Casa de Papel is undoubtedly one of the best series I've seen in my life. It has 5 seasons, the best ones are the first and the second and since the third one is not bad either. There are two robberies, I come to talk a little about the first one without spoilers. This one is for the Fábrica Nacional de Moneda y Timbre (in Spain) and I love the plot and the characters are very elaborate, each one has a story and they come together to rob, which makes the series magical. The loves, friendships, enemies... Everything is fantastic. The scripts and how the story unfolds is simply magnificent. All my respects and appreciation to the cast, the actors are incredible, but above all to the creator, Alex Pina.</p>
